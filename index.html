                    Sniffer is an application designed to help the average pet
                    owner manage their pet’s food allergies. With a search that
                    instantly connects them with a list of foods that fit their
                    dog’s specific needs and a comparison tool that takes two
                    foods and finds any overlapping ingredients, Sniffer makes
                    it easy to quickly zero in on allergies and get your dog on
                    the path to a happier, healthier life.
